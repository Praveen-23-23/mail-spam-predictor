Spam Detection using Machine Learning
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of a Spam Detection System.
It applies machine learning techniques to classify messages as spam or ham (non-spam) using Python and popular data science libraries.

📌 Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning

Text vectorization using TF-IDF

Model training and evaluation

Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall

Easy-to-follow code and explanations in the notebook

📊 Model Workflow
Import Dependencies – Load required Python libraries.

Load Dataset – Read the spam dataset into a DataFrame.

Data Preprocessing – Clean and prepare the data for analysis.

Text Vectorization – Convert text into numerical form using TF-IDF.

Model Training – Train a machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression).

Evaluation – Measure model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
